Refreshing & Adventurous


Goldencity


¾ oz 100% agave tequila
¾ oz Yellow Chartreuse
¾ oz banana liqueur (Giffard preferred)
¾ oz lime juice
2 dashes apricot bitters (Cecil & Merl preferred, but Bitter Truth should work!)


Rinse chilled cocktail glass with absinthe (or pastis)
Shake well with ice, strain and serve up


This one’s somewhere between a Corpse Reviver #2, a Last Word, and a Yellow Parrot. 


Don’t be scared of the banana liqueur, it’s not the horror show you remember from when you were 19.

Adventurous & Spirit-Forward


Four White Violets


¾ oz overproof rhum agricole (Damoiseau preferred)
¾ oz white vermouth (Contratto bianco preferred)
½ oz Dimmi
¼ oz liqueur de violette (Tempus Fugit makes a great one)


Stir, strain into chilled cocktail glass, garnish with an edible flower if you so please.


Sort of an oddball White Negroni? 


Dimmi is an aperitivo made from a nebbiolo grappa macerated with apricot and peach blossoms. Adds a nice aromatic layer. It’s not at all like maraschino liqueur, but some bartenders have suggested it fills a similar space. 


Damoiseau is lightly barrel-aged and sweetened, great in just about anything.




Comforting & Refreshing


Eternal Husband (video)


1 oz unaged apple brandy (Neversink preferred)
1 oz High Wire Black Tea Amaro
½ oz honey syrup (2:1)
½ oz maple syrup (undiluted)
½ oz lemon juice
Hot water


Combine in a mug that will warm your hands (but not scorch them), garnish with a wedge of lemon or orange


Variation on a classic Hot Toddy. 


You could probably get away with substituting Meletti for the amaro if you also use black tea instead of hot water, but I’d highly recommend getting your hands on the High Wire product. It’s made with black tea grown in South Carolina and has lovely, plush tannins.
